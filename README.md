# CPSC x64 Final Project
Affordable housing is a widespread issue which pervades the United States. Yet, despite its magnitude, the allocation system that each jurisdiction uses is quite opaque. Our project aims to fill this gap by leveraging publicly available data specific to Baltimore's low-income housing population. We intend to develop and implement a model that captures the dynamics of the housing allocation system by accounting for factors such as housing vacancy and applicant characteristics. Through this model, we will conduct simulations to illustrate how alternative priority systems might alter the demographic composition of housing recipients within Baltimore. Overall, we aim to provide a data-driven understanding of different affordable housing allocation priority schemes and their possible consequences on tenant demographics. We also assess the fairness and the impact of these schemes.
